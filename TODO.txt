TO DO LIST:

	Put the "load.html" file into PHP.
	Change the Called Data into the SQL Data.
	Add the charts (via the library and the dataset) to the thumbnails.	
	Place into "chart_api.php" as main file used.
	Ben and Troy's tasks:
		A function that allows the user to modify the chart (colours, titles, legend) etc.
				This wasn't a requirement but would be a good optional feature.
				
		Merging the data of one dataset with another to find a correlation (where one would not likely be found).
				All members are lost on this part
				---> It seems you would need to create a temp store of the data in the chart and allow the user to call
				---> this somehow?
